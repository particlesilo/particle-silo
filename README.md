# ParticleSilo

Well-made science communication content are scattered through the web. If one
wants to prepare for a presentation, either for outreach and even for writing
a scientific article for whatever level, it takes time to go through the
internet to look for the best sources for us to find "*the right words", "the
right images*" or the right video to explain a concept with a sense of
satisfaction and clarity in the end. The *"Particle Silo"* project aims to
facilitate this process by providing an **agile**, **personalizable**, and
**shareable** content aggregator that is intuitive to use for science
communicators and learners across different levels.

While the initial project will focus on the Particle Physics ecosystem, our
goal is to expand the project across different fields and to communicate the
idea that science and learning shouldn't be so "siloed" from one another. It
is also envisioned to be a tool for students who want to keep tabs on what
excites science communicators and also as a learning tool to organize
information in the web.

### Contribution-Development Getting Started 

To get started and have a local version of the website on your PC, please install Node.js and npm. 
Once you have npm installed, install yarn. You can use the yarn scripts available in this [README](https://github.com/particlesilo/particlesilo/blob/main/web/README.md). For example, do 

### `brew install yarn`
for MAC
### `yarn install`
### `yarn build`
to build the app for deployment
### `yarn start`
to run the app in development mode which you can view in your browser
