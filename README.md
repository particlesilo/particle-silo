### Contribution-Development Getting Started 

To get started and have a local version of the website on your PC, please install Node.js and npm. 
Once you have npm installed, install yarn. You can use the yarn scripts available in this [README](https://github.com/particlesilo/particlesilo/blob/main/web/README.md). For example, do 

### `yarn build`
